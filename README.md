# HWC-cache
Implementation of the HWC task of second year MIPT programming class.
Authors: Timchenko Daniil, Volozhinov Dmitriy.

This implementation consists of two folders: LIRS cache algorithm implementation and ideal cache algorithm implementation (where algorithm knows order of accessed pages from the beginning), and the comparator program, wich will compare the results of executing two algorithms in the form of showing the amount of time, in wich the programs were executed, and the amount of cache hits of each of them.
